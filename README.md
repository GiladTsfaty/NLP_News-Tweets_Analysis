# NLP Final Project

## Introduction

This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis of news tweets from BBC and CNN. The project aims to analyze the sentiment, word frequency, and other textual features of tweets from these news sources. The analysis includes visualizations such as word clouds, sentiment distribution, and top words bar charts.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `bbc_sample.csv`: Sample tweets from BBC.
- `cnn_sample.csv`: Sample tweets from CNN.
- `NLP Final Project.docx`: Documentation of the project. (in hebrew) 
- `NLP Final Project.pdf`: PDF version of the project documentation. (in hebrew) 
- `NLP_NEWS_TWEETS.py`: Main script for analyzing the news tweets.
- `output.txt`: Output file containing analysis results.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
- `tweets_bbc.csv`: Full dataset of tweets from BBC.
- `tweets_cnn.csv`: Full dataset of tweets from CNN.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.11 installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To perform the analysis, run the NLP_NEWS_TWEETS.py script:

This script will generate various visualizations and output the analysis results to output.txt.

Visualizations
The project generates several visualizations to help understand the data:

- NumberOfTweets.png: Shows the number of tweets over time.
- SentimentDist.png: Displays the distribution of sentiments in the tweets.
- SentimentOverTime.png: Illustrates how sentiment changes over time.
- TopWordsBar.png: Bar chart of the most frequent words in the tweets.
- TopWordsBarCN.png: Bar chart of the most frequent words in CNN tweets.
- WordCloudBBC.png: Word cloud of the most frequent words in BBC tweets.
- WordCloudCNN.png: Word cloud of the most frequent words in CNN tweets.
